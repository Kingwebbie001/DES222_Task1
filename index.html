        <p>The reality is an individual might not even realise how much civil liberty they are trading away. Often it is easy to voluntarily give away slight freedoms, such as anonymity, for comforts that institutions provide. In contemporary society, the majority have already given up utter anonymity, the government knows who you are, where you live, where you work. Just by being born into contemporary society, humans unknowingly sign a contract for the removal of their complete, individual autonomy. However, it is often within a person’s best interests to do so, for what other choice is there. Consequently, a precedence of blind acceptance and normalisation of this is instilled into the contemporary person. So, what happens when the goals of the institution changes?</p>
        <br>
        <p>Government institution’s core values often align with the betterment of society, whereas companies’ primary concern is generating wealth and growth for shareholders. This of course is a blanket statement as corruption presents itself in the public sector and not all companies are driven just by profit margins. However, it is important that there is differentiation between the two, as privatisation and lack of ethics driven governance can allow private organisations to abuse their power.</p>

        <p>In our interconnected and saturated society this happens daily, piece by piece. It is celebrated, the sacrifice of the population’s individual autonomy, personal data eagerly given away for a mere 10% discount. This process is the core of surveillance capitalism, the widespread collection and commodification of personal data by corporations. Organisations have become so dependent on surveillance capitalism that the jobs of the future revolve around it. Data scientists and marketing consultants are incentivised to predict and manipulate consumer behaviour. The consequence is that contemporary society has unwittingly enabled the treatment of people as commodities to be managed and traded. This acceptance of surveillance capitalism diminishes human dignity, foreshadowing a frightening potential future.</p>
        <br>
        <p>A potential future, though dystopian, is a surveillance state where everything an individual does can be indexed and found within seconds. For those who are security minded this might be a utopian future, as many ethical issues like espionage, theft, and domestic abuse, would be impossible to get away with; justice would be unavoidable. So, trading all anonymity would be an easy decision; at least at first glance. In this world, artificial intelligence could predict any desire and deliver products before one could even hope to buy them.</p>

        <p>However, what is lost in such a world? For one, the freedom to express oneself would be greatly diminished, for fear of scrutiny or upheaval. Artists, who often push the boundaries of societal norms, play a crucial role in challenging the status quo, this world would stunt artistic expression. Consequently, imagine a surveillance state existing during the early 20th century, the Pride movement and the gradual acceptance of the LGBTQI+ community would likely have never came to pass. Ultimately, privacy gives people the space to define who they are and gives them the intrinsic ability to differentiate their own moral and ethical compass. By relinquishing even, a portion of one’s privacy, a part of individuality is sacrificed. However, this world has not come to past, hence society should fight tooth and nail to protect the small remaining privacy it has in this digital panopticon.</p>
